WIP

Source of vocabulary sorted by JLPT level is imported from a googlespreadsheet which has its information from Jisho.org.

-An efficient method for storing this information not yet made.

-Also, the actual vocab needs to be modified as kanji is used for some cases where the kanji is not often used or almost NEVER used, this is the case most commmonly in words such as これ・それ・あれ and their derivatives. Also, in common phrase interjections and grammar, さすが as 流石, for example. Although, this isn't completely out of use.
